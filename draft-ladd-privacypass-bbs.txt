Abstract

   Existing token types in privacy pass conflate attribution with rate
   limiting.  This document describes a token type where the issuer
   attests to a set of properties of the client, which the client can
   then selectively prove to the origin.  Repeated showings of the same
   credential are unlinkable, unlike other token types in privacy pass.

1.  Introduction

   In 2004 Boneh-Boyen-Shacham introduced the eponymous BBS signature.
   The BBS signature scheme as documented in [BBS] lets a signer sign a
   sequence of strings called attributes, and provides a way for a
   holder of a signature to prove possession and the value of some of
   the attributes.  This document explains how to use this technology
   with privacy pass.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protcol Overview

   To run this protocol the Issuer must have a public key and an
   issuance URL, as well as a common understanding of the meaning of
   each attribute string (sequence of octets).  E.g an age might be
   encoded as a single octet, or in ASCII numeric base 10
   represnetation, or a fixed field, and could be the first attribute in
   the list.

3.1.  Issuance

   The Client begins by forming a sequence of strings corresponding to
   the attributes they wish signed.  They engage in the Attestation
   protocol with the Attestor, and then send the serialized array of
   strings as JSON array of base64 encoded strings to the Issuer.  The
   Issuer returns the signature, again encoded in base64.  The Client
   MUST verify the returned signature.

   The Attestor interaction and validation of the attributes is not
   specified here.  In a split instantiation as per [PPARCH], Attestors
   and Issuers MUST ensure that the claims by the Client are not
   changeable between attestation and signing.

3.2.  Redemption

   For a client to show a set of attributes they execute the ProofGen
   operation of [BBS] with the header set to a specified channel binding
   or origin identifer.  For HTTP applications it is RECOMMENDED that
   the origin be used.  The set of attributes they wish to show is
   communicated by means outside this draft.  They then transmit the
   signature to the origin as a token.

4.  Privacy Pass integration

   In [PPARCH] parameters are provided that any instantiation must
   amend.  TODO: put values in

5.  Security Considerations

   The position of a revealed attribute, as well as the number of
   unrevealed attributes, is revealed to the origin.  Applications MUST
   ensure all clients recieve the same set of attributes in the same
   positions.  As the redeemed tokens are not single use, instantiations
   MUST specify a channel binding to use or origin identifier.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
