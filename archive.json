The proof's size depends on the number of disclosed attributes.\r\n\r\nHow can this be defined?? \r\n- Define Nk to be N/A in the IANA registry and the authenticator to be something like `uint8_t authenticator<0..2^32>`?? \r\n- Remove the authenticator and add a proof field?? \r\n- Define a constant number of selectively disclosable items, like `[sid, iat, nonce]`?? Or not use attributes at all??",

(like in PR #2).\r\n-  Use [blind BBS signatures](https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-blind-bbs-signatures.html), where the Client \"commits\" to the challenge during issuance (similar to how blind RSA works).\r\n\r\nThe blind BBS signatures document is out of date rn. If it's updated, should it be used instead of the core BBS protocol??",
